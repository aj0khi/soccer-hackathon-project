# Inside the Game

An Azure-ready workspace for turning synthetic, football-realistic events into explainable match intelligence and personalized stories.
- Next.js 16 with the App Router
- React 19 and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- ESLint
- Azure services will be added as the event pipeline is designed

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.

Validation commands:

## Azure event source

The server-only Event Hubs adapter is optional for local development. Set `AZURE_EVENT_HUB_NAMESPACE` and `AZURE_EVENT_HUB_NAME` in `.env.local` to enable it; authentication uses `DefaultAzureCredential`, so local Azure CLI or managed identity credentials can be used without storing a secret in the application.

The adapter ignores malformed payloads and events for other matches. It implements the provider-neutral `EventSource` interface in `src/application/pipeline.ts`, so the local synthetic generator remains available when Azure is not configured.

Foundry role mapping and deployment steps are documented in `docs/FOUNDRY_MAPPING.md`.

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Data rules

- Use synthetic football-realistic data only.
- Keep generated narratives grounded in the event stream and derived metrics.
- Store secrets in `.env.local`; never commit them.
- Keep raw events, derived match state, explanations, and presentation payloads as separate layers.

## Planned boundaries

1. Ingest and validate synthetic events.
2. Aggregate events into match state and football metrics.
3. Explain important changes with evidence from the event stream.
4. Personalize the output for fans, analysts, and studio workflows.
5. Render synchronized insight cards, overlays, and recaps.

## Source layout

- `src/types`: provider-neutral event, insight, and experience contracts.
- `src/application`: pipeline interfaces and orchestration boundaries.
- `src/infrastructure`: future local fixtures and Azure adapters.
- `src/app`: the web experience, to be shaped after the product direction is selected.
- `docs`: architecture decisions and project notes.
